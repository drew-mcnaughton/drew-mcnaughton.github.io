You may be wondering "Why Web Development with a twist?"

Take it from me that this website is not representative of what I have
done in the past. If you want to see some examples have a look at:

[My personal creative website](https://drewmcnaughton.net)

[Leaves for Life](https://leavesfor.life)


Both of the above websites were made with Wordpress but I feel like
I'm moving into a new phase and trying my hand at static website
creation with Jekyll. GitHub pages seems to have been set up for this so
I'm making use of it.

I'm also fairly new to Ruby but it interests me as it is a purely
object-oriented language and I want to focus on learning the principles.

My other lingustic pursuits include Scots Gaelic and I have started a
few repositories already on GitHub which I haven't made public yet but
they will hopefully be ready to share in good time.
