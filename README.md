# drew-mcnaughton.github.io

This is a new base website for my GitHub account using Jekyll and 
the capabilities of Raspberry Pi Zero. I will use it to share a bit
about myself but mostly for testing out different Jekyll themes which
I hope will help me to develop my other Jekyll websites that I will
be hosting on a different server.

So for the time being as this is a public repository it will have an
appropriate license for use by others. See the repo itself for details.
